With this simple script you'll be able to turn the JSON files Spotify spits out when requesting for your information into readable CSV files and nerd out on how many times a single artist appears on your playlists (at least, that's what I did).

### Usage
To use it you need to replace the "/path/to/folder/" in **_Line 168_** with the correct path where your uncompressed zip file is so the script is able to read it.

Just download it and run it dude, I'll make a more thorough guide when I have some free time.

### Important:
By now it only supports the JSON files extracted in the "Account Data".
I'm still working to understand the "Extended Streaming History".
And I don't know if I'll request the "Technical Log Information".



### Request your own Spotify Data
You can go to:
https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/

And if you want to further understand the structure of the JSON files you can read this:
